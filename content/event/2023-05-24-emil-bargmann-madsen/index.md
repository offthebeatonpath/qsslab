"BackgroundWe examine the ‘Villum Experiment’ (VE), a funding program instigated by the Villum Foundation, a Danish private funder who supports blue-sky research in the natural and technical sciences in Denmark. The VE instrument is supposed to support unorthodox ideas in their early phase. More specifically, the instrument was created for those research projects out of the ordinary that challenge the norm and have the potential to change fundamentally the way we approach important topics. The VE should therefore promote ‘risky ideas’ and ‘new paths’ in the natural and technical sciences. Interestingly, to mitigate well-known biases in peer review, applicants are kept anonymous to the reviewers. Assessments are solely based on short structured applications where the focus is upon the ‘idea’, no CVs or names are disclosed. Non-blinded peer reviews are seen as conservative and supposedly incentivise ‘safe applications’. Likewise, exposure of names, affiliations and past performances through CVs is assumed to causes biases resulting in for example, Matthew effects, and gender and ethnicity disparities. A double-blind mechanism is assumed to alleviate such challenges. The questions is to what extent?
MethodsWe use all application data (e.g. names, ids, full text) and review scores from five rounds of applications (2017 to 2021) - corresponding to 2000+ applications with around 250 funded projects. We examine different aspects of the VE programme, such as its mechanisms and potential impacts. Here, we focus on potential gender bias and disparities in who is funded. The current overall application and success rates, somewhat surprisingly, given the double-blinded mechanism, suggest a consistent gender difference where men are seemingly more successful than expected given their share of applications. Despite a double-blinded review process, women are 4.3 percentage points less likely to have their proposals funded than men (9.18 \% vs. 13.5 \%). To make sense of this persistent gender disparity, we use a series of bayesian multilevel models and post-stratification to investigate potential explanations.
Results
Deeper analyses reveal two important self-selection/sorting mechanisms and potential gender disparities related to the demographics of the overall researcher population. First, we show that gender differences in success rates are partly explained by women self-selecting into one evaluation panel ('Life Science') to a much higher degree. Where men are more evenly distributed across the four evaluation panels ('Earth and Space Science', 'Life Science', 'Physical Sciences and Mathematics', 'IT and Engineering'), 46 \% of women applicants apply within life science. Because success rates differ across panels, and the 'Life Science' panel has consistently lower overall funding rates, women tend to self-select into stronger competition. The overall success rate differences are then a case of Simpson's Paradox, where results almost reverse when dis-aggregated across evaluation panels and application years.Second, more experienced applicants tend to be more successful in having their proposals funded, with professors more successful than associate professors, and associate professors more successful than assistant professors and postdocs. However, women comprise a much smaller fraction of the more experienced applicants. Gender differences in funding rates are therefore also a function of the demographic disparity in academic ranks more broadly.Lastly, women comprise around 25 \% of professorships in Denmark and 15 \% within the natural sciences, However, among the applicants with the rank of professor, only 11 \% are women. Using a Multilevel Post-Stratification (MrP) model, we calculate weights and simulate success rates for each academic rank and gender combination among applicants as if they were proportional to the entire population of Danish researchers.The model shows that the remaining gender disparity in funding rates are likely influenced by a lower self-selection into the program by the highly experienced women, and differences would largely disappear if more women applied.In summary, gender disparity can still arise even when doubled-blinded review standards are employed. Larger structural imbalances in field composition and career advancement in the science system contribute to differential success in funding competitions.
SignificanceThe results shed light on two important discussions within science policy. Echoing recent calls for attention \parencite{traag_causal_2022}, we exemplify the importance of distinguishing between gender bias (discrimination) or gender disparity (differences) when assessing fairness in the allocation of merit in science. Gender differences in funding rates can still emerge when bias (conscious or not) in review processes are extremely unlikely, due to indirect causal effects of imbalances in the scientific system. Assessing the mechanisms contributing to gender differences in funding rates are important as changes to peer-review systems cannot eliminate such disparity by itself. Unequal access to research funds are also a product of inbuilt differences in career advancement (i.e. a leaky pipeline), and less representation of women in some fields of science. Solutions to such disparities necessitates a better understanding of the driving factors, because gender bias and structural disparities are not easily solved using the same policies."
