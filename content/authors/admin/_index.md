The Quantitative Science Studies Lab is a research group led by [Philippe Mongeon](/author/philippe-mongeon/), Assistant Professor at the [School of Information Management (SIM)](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/management/school-of-information-management.html), Dalhousie University.

The name of the lab is inspired from the recently launched [Quantitative Science Studies (QSS)](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/qss) journal, the official **open access** journal of the [International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI)](http://www.issi-society.org/)


The lab aims to advance knowledge on the social and informational dynamics of science and its interaction with societal actors, issues and goals.

The site is currently under construction. Check again later or [get in touch](#contact) for more details.
