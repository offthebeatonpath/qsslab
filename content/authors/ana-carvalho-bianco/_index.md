# Bio

My name is Ana and I am a Master Of Industrial Engineering student at Dalhousie University. I pursued my undergraduate studies in Brazil, in Mechanical Engineering, and lived in Canada (Fredericton) for one year as an exchange student. I had the opportunity to get to know Dalhousie when I was a reasearch assistant back in 2018, in the field of Risk Assessment for shipping industries along the Arctic. That led to my Master program two years after, which will be on analysis of frameworks used by some maritime companies. I enjoy spending hours and hours programming, which fit exactly into my thesis reasearch and QSS Lab context. I was introduced to the Data Management area with SUCA team, and now I just can't leave it behind.
