# About Maddie

Maddie Hare is a Master of Information student at Dalhousie University. She graduated from Dalhousie in 2017 and 2021 respectively with her BA and MA, both in History. Her MA thesis studied the plantation records of one Jamaican estate and discussed the amelioration of slavery at the sugar work in its historical and historiographical context. Maddie is embracing data-intensive research and hopes to develop meaningful projects using inclusive data practices that consider real world problems. Her other interests include data literacy, human-information interaction, the curation and preservation of long-term digital cultural memory- the list goes on.
