I am an assistant professor at the [School of Information Management](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/management/school-of-information-management.html) at Dalhousie University, and the director of the Quantitative Science Studies Lab. I am also a associate member of the [Centre interuniversitaire de recherche sur la science et la technologie](https://www.cirst.uqam.ca/en/).

My research uses bibliometric and other quantitative methods to study the dynamics and practices of knowledge production, dissemination and use, as well as research evaluation and governance. More specifically, I work on a broad range of topics, such as research collaboration, scientific misconduct, scholarly publishing, data sharing, research funding, social media, networks, and the evolution of scientific fields. I like to adopt a critical perspective in my research, teaching, and service as I strive to help the scientific communities better fulfill their societal roles.
