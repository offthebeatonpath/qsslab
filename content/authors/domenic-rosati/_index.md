# About me

I am a senior research scientist at [scite.ai](https://scite.ai). My research focuses on developing Natural Language Processing methods to aid in the understanding, evaluation, and synthesis of scientific documents and language artifacts. Primarily, I work on automated discovery and generation of criticism and critical texts. I am particularly interested in understanding foundational aspects of natural language understanding within scientific NLP such as factuality, representation learning, semantics, and narrative construction.
