# About Rodrigo
Dr. Rodrigo Costas is an experienced researcher in the field of information science and bibliometrics. With a PhD in Library and Information Science obtained at the CSIC in Spain, Rodrigo has been working at CWTS (Leiden University, the Netherlands) since 2009. At CWTS Rodrigo also coordinates several projects for different scientific organisations worldwide.
 

His lines of research cover a broad scope of topics, including the development of new bibliometric tools and indicators as well as tools for the study of research activities based on quantitative data, having a particular focus on the analysis of individual scholars through bibliometric methodologies. Rodrigo has recently started some novel research lines at CWTS including the study of ‘altmetrics’ and the possibilities of funding acknowledgments in order to expand the analytical possibilities of scientometrics.
