# About me
I am Pallavi, second-year Master of Information Management student at Dalhousie University. I also hold second Masters in Computer Science from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, India.  I have almost 10 years of experience as an Assistant Professor and Product Support Engineer. I am always fascinated by social media and analyzing social data. My major research area is Machine learning, Natural language processing and social media. Currently, I am in an internship program, working as a Machine Learning Advisor at DeepSense and also involved in two research projects related to COVID-19 on Twitter platform. I am looking forward to exploring more research projects in Data Science.
