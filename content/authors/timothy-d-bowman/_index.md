# About me
I have a Ph.D. from the Department of Information and Library Science, School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University, Bloomington (IUB). At IUB, I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Howard Rosenbaum, Dr. Cassidy R. Sugimoto, and Dr. John A Walsh. I am currently an Assistant Professor at The School of Library and Information Science at Wayne State University (WSU), Detroit, Michigan. Before being hired by WSU, I held a postdoctoral position working with Dr. Kim Holmberg and Dr. Fereshteh Didegah at RUSE, University of Turku, Finland. Prior to my postdoctoral position in Finland, I was a researcher for Dr. Vincent Larivière and Dr. Stefanie Haustein at École de bibliothéconomie et des sciences de l’informationat, Université de Montréal.

My interests include understanding how it is that people interpret the information that their network connections (e.g. friends, followers, etc.) post within social media environments including Twitter, Mendeley, Reddit, and Facebook. How is it that one’s audience understands when something that you have posted to social media is a joke or it is to be taken seriously? How do social media participants understand when their “friends” are speaking from the perspective of their professional lives or their personal lives? How do social media users learn how to make use of features (affordances) within socio-technical ecosystems to assist their audience with correctly interpreting a tweet or post? These issues are of particular interest to me when considering academics and social media use as the more traditional boundaries of personal and professional have become blurred.
