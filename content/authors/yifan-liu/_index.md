# About me
I am a Master of Information student at the School of Information Management at Dalhousie University. I hold a Bachelor of Business Administration w/Honors degree at St. Francis Xavier University in 2018.
My undergrad research used quantitative analysis to collect and analyze user’s search behavior on browsing different websites. Currently, I am interested in the analysis of media-based user engagement and users’ psycho-linguistic phenomena such as emotion, trust, certainties, and deception, etc. Some of my research areas contain data mining, semantic analysis, and cognitive study.
