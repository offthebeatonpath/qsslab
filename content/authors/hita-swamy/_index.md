# About me
I am Hita Swamy from Master of Electronic commerce program from Dalhousie University. It is an unique program offered by three faculties I.e., Faculty of computer science, Business and Law. I have an undergraduate degree in information science and engineering and also worked as a software developer for a brief period of time. During my undergraduate degree , I interned in different organisations but it was during my internship at Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) which is one of the pioneer organisations in space sector where I developed interest in interdisciplinary studies. Added to it as a part of my masterâ€™s degree I did a co-op term with DeepSense under which I worked as a Data Strategist and Technology Consultant for an ocean sector company at Halifax, Canada which further spurred my interest in interdisciplinary studies. Thereby, I would say that I am interested to explore different domains that intersect with data science.
