# Bio
My name is Kashika, and I am a prospective MI student. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science from Trent University and took part in undergraduate research in bloodstain pattern analysis. I have always been keen to work within law enforcement and feel fortunate to be working with the Department of Justice from the last 3 years. However, I recently took a central administrative role with the Human Rights Commission and it’s been a great learning experience so far. After a much longer than anticipated break from school, I now feel ready to get a master’s degree and expand my skill set. I am excited to begin my journey at Dal this fall.
