# About me
I am a researcher at the Institute for the Evaluation of Science and University (INAECU) of  University Carlos III of Madrid. My background is in Geography and I hold an MSc in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a PhD in Library and Information Science at the University Carlos III of Madrid. The topic of my thesis focused in the analysis of the commitment of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to sustainability and to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). My areas of interest include the fields of bibliometrics/scientometrics, sustainability science and citizen science approaches. In this regard, I am currently interested in unraveling how citizens contribute to science and to measure the (mis)alignment between science and society.
