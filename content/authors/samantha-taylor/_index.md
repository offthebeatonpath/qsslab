# About me

I am a senior instructor at the Rowe School of Business at Dalhousie University, lead policy advisor for Chartered Professional Accountants Western School of Business (CPAWSB), educator for the Chartered Professional Accountants Professional Education Program (CPA PEP), a doctoral student at Toulouse Business School, and host of the Sam Taylor podcast.

My research focuses on teaching effectiveness in higher education, concentrating on accounting, education, and technology disciplines. More specifically, creating original pedagogical works, understanding the impact of digital emotional contagion and parasocial relationships on teaching effectiveness, and knowledge mobilization through zero-cost open education resources. My goal is to contribute to empowering learners; I want students to make meaningful goals and have the confidence to chase after them.
