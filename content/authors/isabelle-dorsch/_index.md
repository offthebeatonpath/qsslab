# About me

I am a PhD candidate, research associate and lecturer at the Department of Information Science at the Heinrich Heine University D체sseldorf in Germany.

I focus on social media research and informetrics in general.
Scientometrics, scholarly indicators for research assessment and metrics literacies are fields of research I study or I am interested in. For social media, I especially studied the analysis of user behavior, visual media, hashtags and Instagram. As a lecturer, I already had a chance to teach several classes in information retrieval, knowledge representation and seminars where students develop their own research projects.
