This study focuses on the cost and profit of OA publishing since 2010 by analyzing the publishing market as well as article processing charges for gold and hybrid open access journal publications. More specifically, we aim to answer the following research questions:
- What are the costs associated with articles processing charges for open access journal articles?
 - How much does the academic community (i.e., countries, funders, universities) pay for publishing gold and hybrid open access articles?
 - How much revenues does large publishers generate through open access fees?
