This study focuses on the cost and profit of OA publishing since 2010 by analyzing the publishing market as well as article processing charges for gold and hybrid open access journal publications. More specifically, we aim to answer the following research questions:
- To what extent has the consolidation of the academic publishing market continued in the last decade?
 - What is the percentage of publication output controlled by the oligopoly of academic publishers from 2010 to 2018?
 - How does the share of publications controlled by the oligopoly differ between scientific disciplines and specialties?
- What are the costs associated with articles processing charges for open access journal articles?
 - How much does the academic community (i.e., countries, funders, universities) pay for publishing gold and hybrid open access articles?
 - How much revenues does large publishers generate through open access fees?
