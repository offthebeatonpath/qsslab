This paper analyses three years (2017-2019) of application and review data from the Villum Experiment to analyze how the applicants are distributed by past performance, gender, age, professional status, and institutional affiliations, and how these distributions compare to the overall Danish research population. By doing so, we hope to shed light on whether the bling review process can help prevent the socio-demographic disparity in research funding that could result from a self-selection or peer-review bias. From this overall objective, we derive the two specific research questions: 
- How does the distribution of applicants to the VE across gender, professional status, institutional affiliation, academic age, and past performance compare to the Danish research population?
- How do these characteristics relate to the review outcome?
