The purpose of this paper is to provide a global picture of the current state of OA adoption by countries, using two indicators: publications in OA and references to articles in OA. Our research questions are as follows:
- What proportion of the scientific output of countries is Open Access?
- To what extent are different countries citing literature in open access?
- Does OA publications correlate with OA references at the country level?
- How does OA usage relate to the level of income of countries?
