The term “gender homophily” in citations describes an effect whereby the citer disproportionately cites references from authors who are of the same gender. One of the explanations for men’s disproportionate preference for citing men is the Matilda effect—a systematic under-recognition of women’s contribution to science. Despite these few analyses, the question of homophily in citations has been the focus of few studies. This research intends to fill this gap and map citation patterns of authors of each gender, considering author contribution, research field, and subject similarity.
