This project investigates the different ways in which researchers share scholarly works on Twitter using the socio-topical distance approach proposed by Mongeon (2018). The research questions are as follows:
- What types of Twitter use can be identified using the socio-topical distance approach?
- How are researchers distributed accross the types?
- Are there disciplinary differences in these distributions?
- Are there socio-demographic differences in these distributions?
