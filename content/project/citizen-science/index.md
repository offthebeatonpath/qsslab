Citizen science (CS) is related to the general public engagement in the scientific research process in which the citizens participate in different ways. This project aims to gain a better understanding of the nature and outcomes of CS projects. Our research questions will include: 
- What is the scientific output of these CS projects? 
- What is the nature and degree of citizen involvement in these CS projects? 
- What kind of knowledge is produced from these projects and how does it relate to non-CS research in the same discipline?
