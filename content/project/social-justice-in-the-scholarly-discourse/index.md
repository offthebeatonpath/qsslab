This project will identify scholalry work that mentions social justice issues and identify trends in the prevalence of these mentions in the literature. Some of the questions will be:

- What is the prevalence of social justice related terms in the global academic production over the last 30 years. 
- How do these trends vary depending on the specific social justice issues discussed.
- How do these trends vary by research field?
- How do these trends vary by country?
