## Main goal
This project will identify scholarly work that mentions social justice issues and identify trends in the prevalence of these mentions in the literature.

## Research questions
Some of the questions will be:
- What is the prevalence of social justice related terms in the global academic production over the last 30 years? 
- How do these trends vary depending on the specific social justice issues discussed?
- How do these trends vary by research field?
- How do these trends vary by country?

The site is currently under construction. Check again later or [get in touch](https://qsslab.ca/#contact) for more details.
