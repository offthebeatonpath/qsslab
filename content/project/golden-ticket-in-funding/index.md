In this project hosted by the [Danish Centre for Studies in Research and Research Policy (CFA)](https://ps.au.dk/en/research/research-centres/the-danish-centre-for-studies-in-research-and-research-policy/) we use game theory to investigate the use of the golden ticket by reviewers and its effect on the review outcome of the last three iterations (2017-2019) of the Villum Experiment. More specifically we aim to answer the following research questions:
- How do reviewers use their golden ticket?
- How effective are the golden tickets in getting otherwise unsuccessful proposals funded?
