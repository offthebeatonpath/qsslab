This research in progress uses a game theory framework to investigate the use of the golden ticket by reviewers and its effect on the review outcome of the last three iterations (2017-2019) of the Villum Experiment. More specifically we aim to answer the following research questions:
- How do reviewers use their golden ticket?
- How effective are the golden tickets in getting otherwise unsuccessful proposals funded?
