In this project, we compare the different research novelty measures that have been proposed in the literature by applying them to the same set of publications, and to a set of 1200 funding applications submitted for the Villum Experiment and scored by reviewers for their originality. The research questions are:

- What is research novelty and how can it be measured?
- How do different measures of novelty relate to each other?
- How do different measures of novelty related to expert assessment?

This project is hosted at the [Danish Centre for Studies in Research and Research Policy (CFA)](https://ps.au.dk/en/research/research-centres/the-danish-centre-for-studies-in-research-and-research-policy/).
