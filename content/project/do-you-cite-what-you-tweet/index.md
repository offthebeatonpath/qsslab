This work revisits the relationship between tweets and citations from a new information behavior perspective, where the tweet (and not the tweeted publication) is the unit of analysis. The main question is to determine if, at the individual level, the act of tweeting a given publication is a good predictor of the act of citing that same publication. Also, we investigate how the relationship between tweeting and citing is influenced by the research activity of the tweeter and its relationship to the tweeted paper.
