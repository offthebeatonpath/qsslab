This project investigates how knowledge communities are developed and delineated through scholarly journals. The concept of journal scope is brought to the forefront and measured with a novel indicator that enables to compare the social and topical structures of different journals and seek explanations for the observed differences. 

The main research questions are:
- What is the scope of a journal and how can it be quantified?
- How does the journal scope evolve over time?
- Are there specific factors that can inflience the empirical scope of journals?
